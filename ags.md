Your Current Plan

Top Bar — Workspaces list, clock/calendar, system info (CPU/RAM/etc.), volume control, brightness control.
Side Bar (e.g., dashboard/control center) — More detailed system config/quick settings, notifications list, MPRIS media player controller.
Notification Popups — Custom daemon and popups (great idea, since you're already handling notifications).
Launcher — Your own app launcher (like a custom overview or rofi/wmenu replacement).

This gives you a clean, GNOME-like but fully customized experience on Hyprland.
Potentially Missing Essentials
Based on common AGS/Hyprland setups (from configs like Aylur's, end-4, nine7nine, and community shares), here are the widgets/features most people end up adding because they're either practically useful or fill obvious gaps:

Systray (System Tray)
Icons for apps like Discord, Steam, Bluetooth managers, VPNs, clipboards (e.g., Cliphist), etc. AGS has a built-in SystemTray widget—it's almost always in top bars.
Network Indicator
Wi-Fi/Ethernet status, signal strength, and quick toggle/menu for connections. Often paired with Bluetooth in the top bar or sidebar.
Bluetooth Indicator
Device list and toggles—usually right next to network.
Battery Indicator (if on a laptop)
Percentage, charging status, and sometimes a power mode toggle. On desktops, people often replace it with something else (e.g., weather).
Power Menu / Logout/Shut Down Widget
A button or sidebar section for suspend, reboot, shutdown, lock, and logout. Many configs make this a separate revealable window or part of the sidebar.
Dashboard/Overview
A central "Super key" dashboard that combines:
Quick app launcher/search
Recent/most-used apps
Workspace overview/previews
Maybe a quick calendar or weather glance
(You're making a launcher, so extending it into a full overview would cover this.)

Media Player Widget (expanded)
You mentioned MPRIS in the sidebar—nice! Many also put a compact version (album art + play/pause) in the top bar for at-a-glance control.
Screen Recorder / Screenshot Tool
Quick buttons or keybind-triggered widget for recording or screenshots (integrates with grim/slurp/wf-recorder).
Quick Settings Toggles (in sidebar)
Things like:
DND (Do Not Disturb) toggle
Night light/redshift
Airplane mode
Caffeine/inhibit idle
Keyboard layout switcher

Weather Widget (optional but popular)
Small current conditions/forecast—often in the top bar or dashboard.
Dock or App Launcher Dock (optional)
If you want pinned/favorite apps visible somewhere (bottom or side auto-hiding dock).
OSD (On-Screen Displays)
Transient popups for volume/brightness changes, media track changes, etc. (Not always a full widget, but easy to add with AGS's Overlay or custom windows.)
